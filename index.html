<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p><strong>pyGSTi</strong> is a software package to perform gate set tomography (GST).  GST is a kind of quantum tomography, and it provides full characterization of quantum logic gates on quantum devices such as qubits.  For a basic (albeit out of date) introduction to GST, see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07674">http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07674</a> (by the pyGSTi authors) or <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02921">http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02921</a> (by an independent 3rd party).  The first of these papers describes a relatively recent use of GST, similar to what's in pyGSTi.  The second describes a more primitive initial version of gate set tomography which looks much different than the current pyGSTi code.  More recently, the appendix of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14485">https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14485</a> contains descriptions of GST's major components.</p>

<p>Gate Set Tomography is used to characterize the operations performed by
hardware designed to implement a (small) system of quantum bits (qubits).
Here's the basic idea:</p>

<ol>
<li> you tell pyGSTi what quantum operations you'd like to perform</li>
<li> pyGSTi tells you what sequences of operations it want's data for </li>
<li> you perform the requested experiments and place the resulting </li>
<li> data (outcome counts) into a text file that looks something like:
  <code>
     ## Columns = 0 count, 1 count
     {} 0 100
     Gx 10 90
     GxGy 40 60
     Gx^4 20 80
  </code>
</li>
<li> pyGSTi takes the data file and outputs a "report" - currently a
  HTML web page. </li>
</ol>

<p>pyGSTi is written almost entirely in Python.  Apart from a single (optional!) Cython module, there's no compiling necessary.
The first step is to install <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>iPython (Jupyter) notebook</strong> (if they aren't
installed already).  In order to use pyGSTi you need to
tell your python distribution where pyGSTi lives, which can be done in one
 of three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>run: <code>python install_locally.py</code> </p>

<p>This adds the current pyGSTi path to Python's list of search paths, and
doesn't required administrative access (but only applies to the current user).
Typically you want to do this if you've cloned the pyGSTi GitHub repository 
and want any changes you make to your local file to have effect when you 
<code>import pygsti</code> from Python.  You'd also want to use this option
if you plan to use the tutorial notebook files for a while, since this means
you'll be keeping the pyGSTi directory you unpacked or cloned around for a 
while. This <em>won't</em> build the Cython module, however, so it is now
preferable to use the following approach.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>run: <code>pip install -e /path/to/pyGSTi</code> </p>

<p>This performs the same local type of installation as above, but will 
also build the Cython module.  The only downside of this approach 
compared with the one above, is that it requires you to have <code>pip</code> 
installed. </p>
</li>
  
<li>
<p>run: <code>python setup.py install</code></p>

<p>This installs the pyGSTi package into one of the Python distribution's
search directories.  This typically requires administrative privileges, and
is the way most Python packages are installed.  Installing this way has the
advantage that it makes the package available to all users and then allows 
you to move or delete the directory you're installing from.  If you don't
use this method <strong>you must not delete the pyGSTi directory</strong>
that you cloned or unpacked so long as you want to use pyGSTi.</p>

<p>Reasons you may <em>not</em> want to use this installation method are 
  (1) that you want to access the pyGSTi tutorials for weeks and years to
  or (2) you've cloned the pyGSTi repository and want the resulting local 
  git directory to be the one Python uses when you <code>import pygsti</code>
  (so that when you do a <code>git pull</code> to update the repository,
  this actually updates the behavior in your scripts!).</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>After you've installed pyGSTi, you should be able to 
<code>import pygsti</code> in Python or an iPython (Jupyter) notebook.  The next step is to take a look at
the tutorials.  To do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>change to the notebook directory, by running:
<code>cd jupyter_notebooks</code>  </p></li>
<li><p>start up the Jupyter ipython notebook server by running:
<code>jupyter notebook</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Jupyter server should open up your web browser to the server root.
From there, you can navigate to the "Tutorials" folder and start the 
first tutorial notebook, “00 Quick and easy GST”.  If you're new to Jupyter
notebooks, note that the key command to execute
a cell within a notebook is &lt;Shift+Enter&gt;, not just &lt;Enter&gt;.  Static HTML versions
of these tutorials can be viewed on GitHub as described in the "Tutorials" section below.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations!  You're up and running with pyGSTi!</strong></p>

<h2>
<a id="tutorials" class="anchor" href="#tutorials" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tutorials</h2>

<p>The next step is to checkout pyGSTi's <a href="https://github.com/pyGSTio/pyGSTi/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks/Tutorials">tutorial notebooks</a>, which explain how to get started with pyGSTi.  Following the preceding link and clicking on a notebook file will cause GitHub display a static HTML version of the tutorial.  After installing pyGSTi and Jupyter you'll be able to run the tutorials interactively (see above).  You don't need to work through all of the tutorials to make good use of the software - in fact, Tutorial 0 demonstrates how to go from experimental qubit data to nice shiny reports.  In addition to the tutorials, there are <b><a href="https://github.com/pyGSTio/pyGSTi/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks/Examples">Example notebooks</a></b>.  These are similar to the tutorial notebooks but less pedagogical and more focused on quickly demonstrating how to do a particular task.  The example notebooks sit in a peer directory to the tutorials, and their common parent directory contains a <a href="https://github.com/pyGSTio/pyGSTi/blob/beta/jupyter_notebooks/FAQ.ipynb">Frequently-asked questions</a> notebook that links some of the examples to the questions they're designed to answer.</p>

<p>Don't want to go through all the trouble of installing pyGSTi (even though it's really not that much trouble)?  We've setup a simple online tool where, if you just want to run plain vanilla 1-qubit GST on some data, you can!  First we need to set up an account for you. We hope to automate this in the future, but for now you need to email us at <a href="mailto:pygsti@sandia.gov">pygsti@sandia.gov</a>. We'll send you an email with a link to the online tool and credentials to login; from there you can download a template data file, fill it with data, upload it back to the site, and run GST.  It's like taking candy from a baby...</p>
