    "## Input data types and formats\n",
    "#### What types of data can be analyzed?\n",
    "\n",
    " The methods in this notebook can be used on data from any experiment that satisfies the following criteria: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The experiments consist of $S \\geq 1$ different circuits, or sequences, each with $M \\geq 2$ possible outcomes with $M$ the same for all $S$ circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence $s$ is repeated, and one of the $M$ outcomes is recorded, $N$ times during each of $T$ different time-intervals, with $N$ and $T$ the same for all sequences $s$. Let $\\tau_{s,1},\\tau_{s,2},\\dots,\\tau_{s,T}$ denote times associated with these time-intervals (e.g., the start time or mid-point of each interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time-gap between consecutive sets of $N$ repeats of a sequence is approximately constant, and approximately independent of sequence. That is $t_{s,gap} \\approx \\tau_{s,t+1} - \\tau_{s,t}$ for all $s,t$ and some constant $t_{s,gap}$ (the time gap is constant for each sequence), and $t_{gap} \\equiv t_{s,gap} \\approx t_{s',gap}$ for all $s,s'$ (the time gap is the same for every sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What type of circuits can the data come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many characterization routines, including GST, RPE, restricted sets of GST sequences (e.g., Ramsey sequences) or RB, satisfy the above criteria *if* a suitable time-ordering for the repeats of all of the sequences is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is a full set of GST sequences, with sequence 1 repeated $N=5$ times, then sequence 2 repeated $N=5$ times, etc, with this entire procedure looped through $T = 500$ times. As long as each circuit follows on from the following circuit with a roughly constant time gap, then -- even if the different circuits take varying times to implement -- the time-gaps between consecutive sets of $N$ repeats of each circuit are all the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain best performance, it is preferable to minimize $N$ and maximize $T$ for the same fixed $N \\times T$ (this will provide better detection for high frequency drift).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What input formats can be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two data formats are allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data can be provided to the analysis function in a `pyGSTi` dataset, which can be imported using the `pygsti.io.load_tddataset()` function, demostrated above. The automated input for this currently has limited functionality, and the analysis is much slower when using this form of input. However, this method has the advantage of simplicity: minimal user specification is required when the analysis uses such a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data can be provided to the analysis function as an ordinary numpy array. The analysis is faster when using this format. The array can have a range of different dimensions, but the most flexible format is when the array is 4 dimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will explain the format when the array is 4 dimensional, below we will demonstrate the method with lower dimensional arrays. When the input array is 4 dimensional, the input data format is a numpy array $A$ of dimension $(S \\times E \\times M_{\\rm marg} \\times T)$, where\n",
    "1. $S$ is the number of sequences,\n",
    "2. $E$ is the number of \"entities\" (often 1; and more on this below),\n",
    "3. $M$ is the number of possible measurement outcomes for each circuit,\n",
    "4. $T$ is the number of timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix element $A[s,e,m,t]$ should record the number of counts (a value in $0,1,\\dots,N-1$) for measurement outcome $m$, on entity $e$, for sequence $s$, with the $t^{\\rm th}$ set of repeats for that sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aspect of this array that is perhaps least inuitive is the \"entities\" concept. This allows the storing of independent data for the same circuits, timestamps, and the same possible measurement outcomes for more than one \"entity\". For example, if multiple single-qubit experiments are implemented in parallel, and any correlations between measurement outcomes are discarded, the data from each qubit can be stored with different entity indexes. This then allows for two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The analysis function independently looks for drift in each entity.\n",
    "2. The analysis function combines the data from all entities, to see if that has evidence for drift which was not evident in the analysis of each entity independently. For example, weak evidence for drift in each entity can combine to convincing evidence for drift in the device as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we will discuss further how to use this \"entities\" concept to optimize data analysis, via examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, the input data is stored in the results object as an $(S \\times E \\times M \\times T)$ array, \n",
    "which is the same format as can be used for the input. In our GST example there are 3121 sequences ($S = 3121$), a single entity ($E = 1$), two-outcome measurements ($M=2)$, and 500 timesteps ($T=500$)."

    "## The analysis methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the aim of the methods in this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis presented in this tutorial has two purposes: to detect and characterize drift. To explain this further, we need to define what we mean by drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an underlying probability for circuit $s$ to output the measurement outcome $m$ at time $t$. Denote this by $p_{s,m,t}$, and assume these probabilities satisfy $\\sum_m p_{s,m,t} = 1$ for all $s$ and $t$ (i.e., one of the $M$ measurement outcomes is always observed). By definition, there is no drift if $p_{s,m,t} = p_{s,m,t'}$ for all $s,m,t,t'$. Otherwise there is drift. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiments considered herein, we are essentially taking $N$ samples from a multinomial probability distribution with probability vector $(p_{s,0,t},p_{s,1,t},\\dots)$ for each $s$ and $m$, at a set of equally-spaced times. As such, the data allows us to estimate properties of the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{p}_{s,m} = (p_{s,m,t_1},p_{s,m,t_2},\\dots,p_{s,m,t_3}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our analysis is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Drift Detection:** Starting from the assumption that there is no drift, decide whether there is statistically significant evidence in the data that $p_{s,m,t}$ is *not* independent of $t$.\n",
    "2. **Drift characterization:** Estimate $p_{s,m,t}$ for all sample times $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drift detection and characterization works via spectral analysis, by implement a type of discrete Fourier transform on the data and looking for peaks in the power spectrum that are larger than would be expected if there was no drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, consider a data vector $\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{T-1})$, of the number of counts observed for measurement outcome $m$ with sequence $s$ as a function of time $t \\in [0,1,\\dots,T]$. We remove the data mean from this vector, and renormalize it in a particular way, to obtain the $\\boldsymbol{z}$ vector, defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_{s,m,t} = \\frac{x_{s,m,t} - \\bar{x}_{s,m}}{\\sqrt{ N\\bar{x}_{s,m}(1- \\bar{x}_{s,m})}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't fully explain the reasons for this mapping on $\\boldsymbol{x}$ here, except to note that (1) it is not essential, and (2) the motivation is that -- after this mapping -- the statisical behaviour of the random variable from which $\\boldsymbol{z}$ is drawn, when there is no drift, is largely independent of $N$ and the value of the time-independent probabilitiy $p_{s,m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then perform a Fourier transform on the data -- specifically, we implement a Type-II orthogonal discrete cosine transform (DCT) -- to obtain Fourier modes $ \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{s,m} = F \\boldsymbol{z}_{s,m}$. The precise definition of this transform is not important for obtaining an intuitive understanding of this method, but for completeness it is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "F_{\\omega,t} =\\sqrt{\\frac{2^{1-\\delta_{\\omega,0}}}{N}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\pi}{N}\\left( t + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right), \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "with $\\omega,t=0,\\dots,N-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then square these Fourier modes, to obtain a power spectrum $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{s,m}^2$ for each measurement outcome and each sequence. It is these power spectra that we analyze to detect and characterize drift. We can look at the individual power spectra for a particular sequence and measurement outcome. Using the central limit theorem and some statistics (which we will not cover here), it can be show that -  when there is no drift - each Fourier mode is approximately a zero-mean unit-variance $\\chi^2_1$ random variable. As such, we can calculate the probability that a spike in a power spectrum is due to random statistical flucations, and if this probability is low enough then we can be confident the peak is due to drift. I.e., the underlying $p(t)$ is not constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also average these power spectra over measurement outcomes, and/or over sequences (and over entities, which haven't been discused above, and on which this entire analysis is independently performed). When averaging over all of these quantities, we obtain the global power spectrum presented above. The advantage of this averaging is that it supresses noise from random flucations, but does not supress any \"signal\" due to nonconstant $p(t)$ - as long as the same frequencies are present in many of the power spectra that are being averaged.\n",

This would be problematic for many qubits, as for $Q$ qubits there is $2^Q$ possible measurement outcomes, and the probability of any one outcome being observed will - for many circuits - converge to zero as $Q$ increases. Then, even for very large $T$, there could be, e.g., at most 2 counts for any one measurement outcome, and the power spectra obtained will be useless.\n",

    "However, it is likely in many circumstances that any drift will show up in the marginalized probabilities for obtaining 0 or 1 of each qubit. E.g., in the example above this is precisely what is drifting. We can implement an analysis like this by specifying that the analysis function marginalizes.\n",

In particular, if only the correlations between measurement outcomes are drifting. This is perhaps a rather contrived situation, but it is possible. For example, consider the drifting probabilities:\n",
