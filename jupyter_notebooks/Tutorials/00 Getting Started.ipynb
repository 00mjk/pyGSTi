    "The `pygsti` package provides multiple levels of abstraction over the core Gate Set Tomography (GST) algorithms.  This initial tutorial will show you how to run Gate Set Tomography on some simulated (generated) data, hopefully giving you an overall sense of what it takes (and how easy it is!) to run GST.  Subsequent tutorials will delve into the details of `pygsti` objects and algorithms, and how to use them in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run GST, we need three inputs:\n",
    "1. a \"**target gate set**\" which describes the desired, or ideal, operations we want our experimental hardware to perform.  In the example below, we use one of pyGSTi's \"standard\" gate sets - the on acting on a single qubit with the following operations:\n",
    "    - three gates: the identity, and $\\pi/2$ rotations around the $x$- and $y$-axes.\n",
    "    - a single state preparation in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "    - a 2-outcome measurement with the label \"0\" associated with measuring $|0\\rangle$ and \"1\" with measuring $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. a list of GST sequences corresponding to the target gate set; essentially a list of what experiments (= gate sequences) we need to run.  Using a standard gate set makes things especially straightforward here, since the building blocks, called *germ* and *fiducial* sequences needed to make good GST sequences have already been computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. data, in the form of experimental outcome counts, for each of the required sequences.  In this example we'll generate \"fake\" or \"simulated\" data from a depolarized version of our ideal gate set.\n"
