    "# Circuit Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to create and use simple `Circuit` objects, which represent an ordered sequence of operations.  A `Circuit` may optionally begin with an explicit state-preparation and end with an explicit measurement, but these may be implied by a `Model` which has only a single state-preparation and/or POVM. In some all cases, you'll be using a list (or even a list of lists!) of `Circuit`s, so we'll sometimes be talking about \"circuit lists\".\n",
    "\n",
    "*DEPRECATED TODO: REVISE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH*\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Circuit` object is similar, and sometimes interchangeable, with a Python tuple of *operation labels* (e.g. the names beginning with `G` that label the operations in an `ExplicitOpModel`) or *instrument labels* (beginning with `I`), sometimes sandwiched between a state preparation and POVM (measurement) label.  `Circuit`s can be accessed and operated upon just as a standard Python tuple.  The primary difference between a `Circuit` and a tuple is that a `Circuit` also contains a \"string representation\" of the gate sequence.  This string representation gets carried along for the ride until it's needed, typically when writing a the operation sequence to a file.  The string representation must *evaluate*, using pyGSTi's allowed text format for operation sequences (see below), to the tuple-of-gate-labels, or \"tuple representation\".  The string representation is intended to contain a compact and intuitive human-readable form of the gate sequence that is used for display purposes.  For example, the operation sequence `('Gx','Gx','Gx','Gx','Gx')` might have the string representation `\"Gx^5\"`.  If needed, the tuple and string representations of any `Circuit`  `g` can be accessed via `g.tup` or `tuple(g)` and `g.str` or `str(g)` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits are central to LinearOperator Set Tomography, as they describe both real and \"simulated\" experiments.  A `Circuit`'s ordered sequence tells the experimentalist which gates they must execute on their hardware and likewise what order to compose the operations contained in a `Model` (e.g. multiply the matrices in a `ExplicitOpModel`).  When a state preparation or POVM label is omitted from the beginning or end of a operation sequence, respectively, one must be *inferred*.  This is currently only possible when the relevant `Model` object holds only a single state preparation or POVM.  The outcomes of an experiment are labeled by 1-tuples of the given (or inferred) POVM effect labels.  When the operation sequence contains instruments (which produce intermediate measurement outcomes), the \"outcome label\" is a tuple of length greater than one, where each element correponds to the outcome of a single instrument or the final POVM.  Thus, by repeating an experiment one obtains counts and thereby frequencies for each outcome label.  Given an `ExplicitOpModel` one can obtain corresponding probabilities by muliplying operation matrices and contracting the product between a state preparation and POVM effect vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **ordering direction** is important.  The elements of a `Circuit` are read from **left-to-right**, meaning the first (left-most) operation label is performed first.  This is very natural for experiments since one can read the operation sequence as a script, executing each gate as one reads from left to right.  However, since we insist on \"normal\" matrix multiplication conventions, the ordering of the matrix product is *reversed* from that of the operation sequence.  For example, the operation sequence `('Ga','Gb','Gc')`, in which Ga is performed first, corresponds to the matrix product $G_c G_b G_a$.  The probability of this operation sequence for a SPAM label associated with the (column) vectors ($\\rho_0$,$E_0$) is given by $E_0^T G_c G_b G_a \\rho_0$, which can be interpreted as \"prepare state 0 first, then apply gate A, then B, then C, and finally measure effect 0\".  While this nuance is typically hidden from the user (the `Model` functions which compute products and probabilities from `Circuit`s perform the order reversal internally), it becomes very important if you plan to perform such products by hand. \n",

    "We'll now go over some examples of how to create and use a single `Circuit`."

    "## Gate Label \"Aliases\"\n",
    "A similar but simpler type of manipulation called \"operation label aliasing\" is used in pyGSTi to map a operation label into another operation label **only for `DataSet` lookups**.  The mapping is similar to `manipulate_circuit`'s find & replace functionality, except that (at least currently) the string to find can be only a single operation label  (and so isn't even a string at all). The support for operation label aliasing within pyGSTi's algorithms aids in mapping many `Model` models onto the same data (often with simpler gate labelling). "
