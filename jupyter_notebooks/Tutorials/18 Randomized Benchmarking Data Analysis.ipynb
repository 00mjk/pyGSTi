    "This tutorial demonstrates how to generate [\"Direct randomized benchmarking\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07975) (DRB) circuits using `pygsti`. This is a recently proposed alternative to [\"Clifford RB\"](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.180504), with the same basic aim as Clifford RB - to estimate an error rate that provides a meaure of average gate performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clifford RB and Direct RB can be implemented (holistically) on a set of $n$ qubits whenever the $n$-qubit Clifford group can be generated by the gates in the device. But whereas Clifford RB has sequences of uniformly random $n$-qubit Cliffords compiled into the native gates, a DRB circuit consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A circuit that generates a uniformly random $n$-qubit stabilizer state.\n",
    "2. $m$ independently sampled layers of the native gates in the device, with these layers sampled according to a user-specified distribution $\\Omega$ over all possible circuit layers.\n",
    "3. A circuit that maps the ideal output of the preceeding circuit to a uniformly random computational basis state (or, if preferred, to the all-zeros state).\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol can be implemented on more qubits that Clifford RB, and has similar levels of reliability to Clifford RB (if $\\Omega$ is chosen reasonably carefully). \n",
    "\n",
    "One important point to note is that the DRB error rate is $\\Omega$-dependent. I.e., it quantifies gate performance over circuits that are sampled according to $\\Omega$. This is analogous to the Clifford-compiler dependence of the Clifford RB error rate, but it is more easily controlled and understood. This tutorial will not provide comprehensive details on DRB; see [\"Direct randomized benchmarking for multi-qubit devices\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07975) for more information."
