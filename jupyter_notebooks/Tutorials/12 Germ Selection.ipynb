    "# Germ Selection\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate \"germ selection\".  Germ selection is the process by which a complete set of germ gate sequences is constructed.  The defining property which makes a set of gate sequences a \"complete germ set\" is the amplification of *all* possible gate errors.  More precisely, the repetition of a complete set of germs, sandwiched between preparation and measurement fiducial sequences, will yield a sensitivity to *all* gate errors that scales with the number of times each germ is repeated.  This completeness is relative to the set of gates under consideration, typically a set of desired or \"target\" gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we find a complete germ set for the standard $X(\\pi/2)$, $Y(\\pi/2)$, $I$ gate set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, however, we note the following:  This tutorial notebook is slightly different from others.  At present, germ selection is a bit of a \"dark art\".  While we have a simple function (pygsti.algorithms.germselection.test_germ_list_infl) for determining whether or not a germ set is \"amplificationally complete\" (AC), we do not at present have a method for *optimally* selecting such a set (in particular, selecting a set that is as small as possible).  This is in part because the germ list scoring function does a good job of distinguishing between AC and non-AC sets, it does less well distinguishing between sets that are both AC.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to generate an AC germ set, as well as demonstrating the functionality of several auxiliary functions we've developed to assist in the process.  However, it should not be taken as optimal; in particular, one may find better (smaller) AC germ sets by repeatedly running the germ selection function, seeded with an AC germ set plus a collection of further candidate germs, as demonstrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the theory of germ selection, please see arXiv:1605.07674."

    "The germ selection algorithm works by throwing unnecessary germs away from an initial (large) list that is assumed to be complete.  In this example, our initial list includes all gatestrings up to length six that are distinct up to powers and cycles.  Since germ sequences are repeated and sandwiched between fiducial sequences, a germ that is a power of another germ (i.e. the other germ repeated some number of times) or that is a cyclic permutation of another germ is effectively the same as the other germ.
