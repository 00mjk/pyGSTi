    "# Report Generation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi is able to construct polished report documents, which provide high-level summaries as well as detailed analyses of results (Gate Set Tomography (GST) and model-testing results in particular).  Reports are intended to be quick and easy way of analyzing `Model`-type estimates, and pyGSTi's report generation functions are specifically designed to interact with the `ModelEstimateResults` object (producted by several high-level algorithm functions - see, for example, the [GST overview tutorial](../algorithms/GST-Overview.ipynb) and [GST functions tutorial](../algorithms/GST-Drivers.ipynb).).  The report generation functions in pyGSTi takes one or more results (often `ModelEstimateResults`-type) objects as input and produces an HTML file as output.  The HTML format allows the reports to include **interactive plots** and **switches** (see the [workspace switchboard tutorial](advanced/WorkspaceSwitchboards.ipynb), making it easy to compare different types of analysis or data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi's reports are stand-alone HTML documents which cannot run Python.  Thus, all the results displayed in a report must be pre-computed (in Python).  If you find yourself wanting to fiddle with things and feel that these reports are too static, please consider using a `Workspace` object (see the [Workspace tutorial](Workspace.ipynb)) within a Jupyter notebook, where you can intermix report tables/plots and Python.  Internally, functions like `construct_standard_report` (see below) are simple factories for `Report` objects, which are in turn little more than a wrapper around a `Workspace` object and a set of instructions for how to generate reports of different output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get some `ModelEstimateResults`\n",
    "We start by performing GST using `do_long_sequence_gst`, as usual, to create a `ModelEstimateResults` object (we could also have just loaded one from file).  See the [GST functions tutorial](../algorithms/GST-Driverfunctions.ipynb) for more details."

    "There are several remarks about these reports worth noting:\n",
    "1. The **HTML reports are the primary report type in pyGSTi**, and are much more flexible.  The PDF reports are more limited (they can only display a *single* estimate and gauge optimization), and essentially contain a subset of the information and descriptive text of a HTML report.  So, if you can, use the HTML reports.  The PDF report's strength is its portability: PDFs are easily displayed by many devices, and they embed all that they need neatly into a single file.  **If you need to generate a PDF report** from `Results` objects that have multiple estimates and/or gauge optimizations, consider using the `Results` object's `view` method to single out the estimate and gauge optimization you're after.\n",
    "2. It's best to use **Firefox** when opening the HTML reports. (If there's a problem with your brower's capabilities it will be shown on the screen when you try to load the report.)\n",
    "3. You'll need **`pdflatex`** on your system to compile PDF reports.\n",

In each case we'll call `do_long_sequence_gst` with `gaugeOptParams=False`, so that no gauge optimization is done, and then perform several gauge optimizations separately and add these to the `Results` object via its `add_gaugeoptimized` function."

By calling `Report.write_notebook`, all of the relevant `Workspace` initialization and calls are dumped to a new notebook file, which can be run (either fully or partially) by the user at their convenience.  Creating such \"report notebooks\" has the advantage that the user may insert Python code amidst the figure and table generation calls to inspect or modify what is display in a highly customizable fashion.  The chief disadvantages of report notebooks is that they require the user to 1) have a Jupyter server up and running and 2) to run the notebook before any figures are displayed.\n",

    "## Multi-qubit reports\n",
    "The dimension of the density matrix space with with more than 2 qubits starts to become quite large, and Models for 3+ qubits rarely allow every element of the operation process matrices to vary independently.  As such, many of the figures generated by `construct_standard_report` are both too unwieldy (displaying a $64 \\times 64$ grid of colored boxes for each operation) and not very helpful (you don't often care about what each element of an operation matrix is).  For this purpose, we are developing a report that doesn't just dump out and analyze operation matrices as a whole, but looks at a `Model`'s structure to determine how best to report quantities.  This \"n-qubit report\" is invoked using `pygsti.report.construct_nqnoise_report`, and has similar arguments to `construct_standard_report`.  It is, however <b style=\"color:red\">still under development</b>, and while you're welcome to try it out, it may crash or not work in other weird ways."
