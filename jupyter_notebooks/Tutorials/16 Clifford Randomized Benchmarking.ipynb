The literature convention is that $m$ corresponds to the number of independent, uniformly random Clifford gates in the uncompiled circuit. So this is the number of Clifford gates in the uncompiled circuit minus 1 (the inversion Clifford gate is uniquely defined by the preceeding sequence).\n",

Note that rescaling $m$ by adding a constant is entirely a matter of convention, because RB data is fit to the function $P_m = A + Bp^m$ so mapping $m \\to m + c$ will not change the obtained value of $p$ (and $p$ fixes the RB error rate).\n",

It will not be possible to analyze the results of the RB experiments without these bit-strings: because \"success\" corresponds to the circuit output being the particular bit stored here. (These bit-strings can always be re-calculated from the circuits, but doing this with `pyGSTi` requires accessing functions that are currently not demonstrated in any tutorial).\n",

    "Note that the 'idealout' bitstring assumes the input is ideally $0,0,0,\\dots$. So if you use an input state other than $0,0,0,\\dots$ it will be necessary to correct for this. E.g., if you start in the computational basis state $1,0,0,\\dots$ you would need to add this bit-string modulo 2 to the 'idealout' bit-string.\n",
