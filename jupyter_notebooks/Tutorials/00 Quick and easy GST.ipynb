    "Before experimental data is obtained, it is useful to create a \"template\" dataset file which specifies which gate sequences are required to run GST.  Since we don't actually have an experiment for this example, we'll generate some \"fake\" experimental data from a set of gates that are just depolarized versions of the targets.  First we construct the list of experiments used by GST using `make_lsgst_experiment_list`, and use the result to specify which experiments to simulate.  The abbreviation \"LSGST\" (lowercase in function names to follow Python naming conventions) stands for \"Long Sequence Gate Set Tomography\", and refers to the more powerful flavor of GST that utilizes long sequences to find gate set estimates.  LSGST can be compared to Linear GST, or \"LGST\", which only uses short sequences and as a result provides much less accurate estimates."

    "- `gaugeOptParams` specifies a dictionary of parameters ultimately to be passed to the `gaugeopt_to_target` function (which provides full documentation).  We set the ratio of the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) weighting to the gate weighting when performing a gauge optimization.  When this is set as below, the gate parameters are weighted 1000 times more relative to the SPAM parameters.  Mathematically this corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 0.001 preceding the sum-of-squared-difference terms corresponding to SPAM elements in the gateset.   Typically it is good to weight the gates parameters more heavily since GST amplifies gate parameter errors via long gate sequences but cannot amplify SPAM parameter errors.  If unsure, 0.001 is a good value to start with."
