Since we don't actually have an experiment for this example, we'll generate some \"fake\" experimental data from a set of gates that are just depolarized versions of the targets.  First we construct the list of experiments used by GST using `make_lsgst_experiment_list`, and use the result to specify which experiments to simulate.
