In this example, we'll generate the data using a depolarizing noise model since we don't have a real quantum processor lying around.  The call to `fill_in_empty_dataset_with_fake_data` should be replaced with the user filling out the empty \"template\" data set file with real data.  Note also that we set `clobber_ok=True`; this is so the tutorial can be run multiple times without having to manually remove the dataset.txt file - we recommend you leave this set to False (the default) when using it in your own scripts."
