    "\n",
    " The methods in this notebook can be used on data from any experiment that satisfies the following criteria: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The experiments consist of $S \\geq 1$ different circuits, or sequences, each with $M \\geq 2$ possible outcomes with $M$ the same for all $S$ circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence $s$ is repeated, and one of the $M$ outcomes is recorded, $N$ times during each of $T$ different time-intervals, with $N$ and $T$ the same for all sequences $s$. Let $\\tau_{s,1},\\tau_{s,2},\\dots,\\tau_{s,T}$ denote times associated with these time-intervals (e.g., the start time or mid-point of each interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time-gap between consecutive sets of $N$ repeats of a sequence is approximately constant, and approximately independent of sequence. That is $t_{s,gap} \\approx \\tau_{s,t+1} - \\tau_{s,t}$ for all $s,t$ and some constant $t_{s,gap}$ (the time gap is constant for each sequence), and $t_{gap} \\equiv t_{s,gap} \\approx t_{s',gap}$ for all $s,s'$ (the time gap is the same for every sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What type of circuits can the data come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many characterization routines, including GST, RPE, restricted sets of GST sequences (e.g., Ramsey sequences) or RB, satisfy the above criteria *if* a suitable time-ordering for the repeats of all of the sequences is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is a full set of GST sequences, with sequence 1 repeated $N=5$ times, then sequence 2 repeated $N=5$ times, etc, with this entire procedure looped through $T = 500$ times. As long as each circuit follows on from the following circuit with a roughly constant time gap, then -- even if the different circuits take varying times to implement -- the time-gaps between consecutive sets of $N$ repeats of each circuit are all the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain best performance, it is preferable to minimize $N$ and maximize $T$ for the same fixed $N \\times T$ (this will provide better detection for high frequency drift).\n",

Then, even for very large $T$, there could be, e.g., at most 2 counts for any one measurement outcome, and the power spectra obtained will be useless.\n",
