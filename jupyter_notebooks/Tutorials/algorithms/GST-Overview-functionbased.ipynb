    "This tutorial shows you how to run gate set tomography using the older-style function-centric API.  This can be useful in certain scenarios, but most of the time it's easier to use the newer, object-oriented approach outlined in the main [GST overview tutorial](GST-Overview.ipynb).  For more details and options for running GST, see the [GST circuits tutorial](../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb) and the [tutorial covering the different pyGSTi functions for running GST](GST-Drivers.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run GST, we need three inputs:\n",
    "1. a \"**target model**\" which describes the desired, or ideal, operations we want our experimental hardware to perform.  In the example below, we use one of pyGSTi's build-in \"model packs\" (see the [tutorial on model packs](objects/advanced/ModelPacks.ipynb)) - which acts on a single qubit with the following operations:\n",
    "    - three gates: the identity, and $\\pi/2$ rotations around the $x$- and $y$-axes.\n",
    "    - a single state preparation in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "    - a 2-outcome measurement with the label \"0\" associated with measuring $|0\\rangle$ and \"1\" with measuring $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. a list of circuits tailored to the target model; essentially a list of what experiments we need to run.  Using a standard model makes things especially straightforward here, since the building blocks, called *germ* and *fiducial* circuits, needed to make good GST circuits have already been computed (see the [tutorial on GST circuits](../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. data, in the form of experimental outcome counts, for each of the required sequences.  In this example we'll generate \"fake\" or \"simulated\" data from a depolarized version of our ideal model.  For more information about `DataSet` objects, see the [tutorial on DataSets](../objects/DataSet.ipynb).\n"
