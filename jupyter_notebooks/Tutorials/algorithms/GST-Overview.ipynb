    "The `pygsti` package provides multiple levels of abstraction over the core Gate Set Tomography (GST) algorithms.  This tutorial will show you how to run Gate Set Tomography on some simulated (generated) data, hopefully giving you an overall sense of what it takes (and how easy it is!) to run GST.  For more details and options for running GST, see the [GST circuits tutorial](../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb) and the [tutorial covering the different pyGSTi functions for running GST](GST-Drivers.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run GST, we need three inputs:\n",
    "1. a \"**target model**\" which describes the desired, or ideal, operations we want our experimental hardware to perform.  In the example below, we use one of pyGSTi's \"standard\" models (see the [tutorial on standard modules](objects/advanced/StandardModules.ipynb)) - which acts on a single qubit with the following operations:\n",
    "    - three gates: the identity, and $\\pi/2$ rotations around the $x$- and $y$-axes.\n",
    "    - a single state preparation in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "    - a 2-outcome measurement with the label \"0\" associated with measuring $|0\\rangle$ and \"1\" with measuring $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. a list of circuits tailored to the target model; essentially a list of what experiments we need to run.  Using a standard model makes things especially straightforward here, since the building blocks, called *germ* and *fiducial* circuits, needed to make good GST circuits have already been computed (see the [tutorial on GST circuits](../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. data, in the form of experimental outcome counts, for each of the required sequences.  In this example we'll generate \"fake\" or \"simulated\" data from a depolarized version of our ideal model.  For more information about `DataSet` objects, see the [tutorial on DataSets](../objects/DataSet.ipynb).\n"
