    "# Multi-Qubit Devices: the `QubitProcessorSpec` object\n",
    "This tutorial covers the creation and use of `ProccesorSpec` objects.  These objects are used to define the \"specification\" of a quantum information processor (QIP) (e.g., device connectivity, the gate-set, etc.), and are particularly geared towards multi-qubit devices. Currently, these are mostly encountered in pyGSTi as an input for generating randomized benchmarking experiments, but they will be used more widely in future releases."

    "## Using a `QubitProcessorSpec` to specify a multi-qubit device.\n",
    "The `QubitProcessorSpec` object is designed to encapsulate the specification of a small to medium-scale quantum computer, and to hold a variety of useful things that can be derived from this information. The basic information that a `QubitProcessorSpec` is initialized via is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of qubits in the device, and, optionally, the labels of these qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The target gate-set of the device, as either unitary matrices or using names that point to in-built unitary matrices. E.g., 'Gcnot' is a shorthand for specifying a CNOT gate. Normally this will be the \"primitive\" gates of the device, although it may sometimes be useful to choose other gate-sets (it depends what you are then going to use the `QubitProcessorSpec` for). Currently only discrete gate-sets are supported. E.g., there is no way to specify an arbitrary $\\sigma_z$-rotation as one of the gates in the device. \"Continuously parameterized\" gates such as this may be supported in the future.\n",

The full set of in-built names is specified in the dictionary returned by `pygsti.tools.internalgates.standard_gatename_unitaries()`, and note that there is redundency in this set. E.g., 'Gi' is a 1-qubit identity gate but so is 'Gc0' (as one of the 24 1-qubit Cliffords named as 'Gci' for i = 0, 1, 2, ...).  Note that typically we *do not specify an idle/identity gate* as one of the primitives, unless there's a particular type of global-idle gate we're trying to model.  (Specifying an idle gate may also be more appropriate for 1- and 2-qubit devices, since in these small-system cases we may label each circuit layer separatey.)"
