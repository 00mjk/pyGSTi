def distribute_indices(indices, comm, allow_split_comm=True):

    Partition an array of indices (any type) evenly among `comm`'s processors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : list
        An array of items (any type) which are to be partitioned.

    comm : mpi4py.MPI.Comm
        The communicator which specifies the number of processors and
        which may be split into returned sub-communicators.

    allow_split_comm : bool
        If True, when there are more processors than indices,
        multiple processors will be given the *same* set of local
        indices and `comm` will be split into sub-communicators,
        one for each group of processors that are given the same
        indices.  If False, then "extra" processors are simply given
        nothing to do, i.e. empty lists of local indices.

    Returns
    -------
    loc_indices : list
        A list containing the elements of `indices` belonging to the current
        processor.
    owners : dict
        A dictionary mapping the elements of `indices` to integer ranks, such
        that `owners[el]` gives the rank of the processor responsible for
        communicating that element's results to the other processors.  Note that
        in the case when `allow_split_comm=True` and multiple procesors have
        computed the results for a given element, only a single (the first)
        processor rank "owns" the element, and is thus responsible for sharing
        the results.  This notion of ownership is useful when gathering the
        results.
    loc_comm : mpi4py.MPI.Comm or None
        The local communicator for the group of processors which have been

        If `loc_indices` is unique to the current processor, or if

    Partition an array of "indices" evenly among a given number of "processors"

    This function is similar to :func:`distribute_indices`, but allows for more
    a more generalized notion of what a "processor" is, since the number of
    processors and rank are given independently and do not have to be
    associated with an MPI comm.  Note also that `indices` can be an arbitrary
    list of items, making this function very general.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : list
        An array of items (any type) which are to be partitioned.

    nprocs : int
        The number of "processors" to distribute the elements of

    rank : int

    """
    Gathers data within a numpy array, `ar_to_fill`, according to given indices.

    Upon entry it is assumed that the different processors within `comm` have
    computed different parts of `ar_to_fill`, namely different slices or
    index-arrays of the `axis`-th axis.  At exit, data has been gathered such
    that all processors have the results for the entire `ar_to_fill` (or at least
    for all the indices given).

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : list
        A list of all the integer-arrays or slices (computed by *any* of
        the processors, not just the current one).  Each element of `indices`
        may be either a single slice/index-array or a tuple of such
        elements (when gathering across multiple dimensions).

    index_owners : dict
        A dictionary mapping the index of an element within `slices` to an
        integer rank of the processor responsible for communicating that
        slice/index-array's data to the rest of the processors.

    ar_to_fill : numpy.ndarray
        The array which contains partial data upon entry and the gathered
        data upon exit.

    ar_to_fill_inds : list
        A list of slice or index-arrays specifying the (fixed) sub-array of
        `ar_to_fill` that should be gathered into.  The elements of
        `ar_to_fill_inds` are taken to be indices for the leading dimension
        first, and any unspecified dimensions or `None` elements are
        assumed to be unrestricted (as if `slice(None,None)`).  Note that
        the combination of `ar_to_fill` and `ar_to_fill_inds` is essentally like
        passing `ar_to_fill[ar_to_fill_inds]` to this function, except it will
        work with index arrays as well as slices.

    axes : int or tuple of ints
        The axis or axes of `ar_to_fill` on which the slices apply (which axis
        do the elements of `indices` refer to?).  Note that `len(axes)` must
        be equal to the number of sub-indices (i.e. the tuple length) of each
        element of `indices`.

    comm : mpi4py.MPI.Comm or None
        The communicator specifying the processors involved and used
        to perform the gather operation.

    max_buffer_size : int or None
        The maximum buffer size in bytes that is allowed to be used
        for gathering data.  If None, there is no limit.
