    Create a set of operation sequence lists for LSGST based on germs and max-lengths.

    Constructs a series (a list) of operation sequence lists used by long-sequence GST
    (LSGST) algorithms.  If `include_lgst == True` then the starting list is the
    list of LGST strings, otherwise the starting list is empty.  For each
    nonzero element of max_length_list, call it L, a list of operation sequences is
    created with the form:

    Case: trunc_scheme == 'whole germ powers':
      prepStr + pygsti.construction.repeat_with_max_length(germ,L) + effectStr

    Case: trunc_scheme == 'truncated germ powers':
      prepStr + pygsti.construction.repeat_and_truncate(germ,L) + effectStr

    Case: trunc_scheme == 'length as exponent':
      prepStr + germ^L + effectStr

    If nest == True, the above list is iteratively *added* (w/duplicates
    removed) to the current list of operation sequences to form a final list for the
    given L.  This results in successively larger lists, each of which
    contains all the elements of previous-L lists.  If nest == False then
    the above list *is* the final list for the given L.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op_label_src : list or Model
        List of operation labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a Model,
        then the model's gate and instrument labels are used. Only
        relevant when `include_lgst == True`.

    prep_strs : list of Circuits
        List of the preparation fiducial operation sequences, which follow state
        preparation.

    effect_strs : list of Circuits
        List of the measurement fiducial operation sequences, which precede
        measurement.

    germ_list : list of Circuits
        List of the germ operation sequences.

    max_length_list : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths. A zero value in this list has special
        meaning, and corresponds to the LGST sequences.

    fid_pairs : list of 2-tuples or dict, optional
        Specifies a subset of all fiducial string pairs (prepStr, effectStr)
        to be used in the operation sequence lists.  If a list, each element of
        fid_pairs is a (iPrepStr, iEffectStr) 2-tuple of integers, each
        indexing a string within prep_strs and effect_strs, respectively, so
        that prepStr = prep_strs[iPrepStr] and effectStr =
        effect_strs[iEffectStr].  If a dictionary, keys are germs (elements
        of germ_list) and values are lists of 2-tuples specifying the pairs
        to use for that germ.

    trunc_scheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means. If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    nest : boolean, optional
        If True, the returned operation sequence lists are "nested", meaning
        that each successive list of operation sequences contains all the gate
        strings found in previous lists (and usually some additional
        new ones).  If False, then the returned string list for maximum
        length == L contains *only* those operation sequences specified in the
        description above, and *not* those for previous values of L.

    keep_fraction : float, optional
        The fraction of fiducial pairs selected for each germ-power base
        string.  The default includes all fiducial pairs.  Note that
        for each germ-power the selected pairs are *different* random
        sets of all possible pairs (unlike fid_pairs, which specifies the
        *same* fiducial pairs for *all* same-germ base strings).  If
        fid_pairs is used in conjuction with keep_fraction, the pairs
        specified by fid_pairs are always selected, and any additional
        pairs are randomly selected.

    keep_seed : int, optional
        The seed used for random fiducial pair selection (only relevant
        when keep_fraction < 1).

    include_lgst : boolean, optional
        If true, then the starting list (only applicable when
        `nest == True`) is the list of LGST strings rather than the
        empty list.  This means that when `nest == True`, the LGST
        sequences will be included in all the lists.

    germ_length_limits : dict, optional
        A dictionary limiting the max-length values used for specific germs.
        Keys are germ sequences and values are integers.  For example, if
        this argument is `{('Gx',): 4}` and `max_length_list = [1,2,4,8,16]`,
        then the germ `('Gx',)` is only repeated using max-lengths of 1, 2,
        and 4 (whereas other germs use all the values in `max_length_list`).

    Returns
    -------
    list of (lists of Circuits)
        The i-th list corresponds to a operation sequence list containing repeated
        germs limited to length max_length_list[i].  If nest == True, then
        repeated germs limited to previous max-lengths are also included.
        Note that a "0" maximum-length corresponds to the LGST strings.

    Create a set of long-sequence GST circuit lists (including structure).

    Constructs a series (a list) of operation sequence structures used by long-sequence
    GST (LSGST) algorithms.  If `include_lgst == True` then the starting
    structure contains the LGST strings, otherwise the starting structure is
    empty.  For each nonzero element of max_length_list, call it L, a set of
    operation sequences is created with the form:

    Case: trunc_scheme == 'whole germ powers':
      prepStr + pygsti.construction.repeat_with_max_length(germ,L) + effectStr

    Case: trunc_scheme == 'truncated germ powers':
      prepStr + pygsti.construction.repeat_and_truncate(germ,L) + effectStr

    Case: trunc_scheme == 'length as exponent':
      prepStr + germ^L + effectStr

    If nest == True, the above set is iteratively *added* (w/duplicates
    removed) to the current operation sequence structure to form a final structure for
    the given L.  This results in successively larger structures, each of which
    contains all the elements of previous-L structures.  If nest == False then
    the above set *is* the final structure for the given L.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op_label_src : list or Model
        List of operation labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a Model,
        then the model's gate and instrument labels are used. Only
        relevant when `include_lgst == True`.

    prep_strs : list of Circuits
        List of the preparation fiducial operation sequences, which follow state
        preparation.

    effect_strs : list of Circuits
        List of the measurement fiducial operation sequences, which precede
        measurement.

    germ_list : list of Circuits
        List of the germ operation sequences.

    max_length_list : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths. A zero value in this list has special
        meaning, and corresponds to the LGST sequences.

    fid_pairs : list of 2-tuples or dict, optional
        Specifies a subset of all fiducial string pairs (prepStr, effectStr)
        to be used in the operation sequence lists.  If a list, each element of
        fid_pairs is a (iPrepStr, iEffectStr) 2-tuple of integers, each
        indexing a string within prep_strs and effect_strs, respectively, so
        that prepStr = prep_strs[iPrepStr] and effectStr =
        effect_strs[iEffectStr].  If a dictionary, keys are germs (elements
        of germ_list) and values are lists of 2-tuples specifying the pairs
        to use for that germ.

    trunc_scheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means. If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    nest : boolean, optional
        If True, the returned operation sequence lists are "nested", meaning
        that each successive list of operation sequences contains all the gate
        strings found in previous lists (and usually some additional
        new ones).  If False, then the returned string list for maximum
        length == L contains *only* those operation sequences specified in the
        description above, and *not* those for previous values of L.

    keep_fraction : float, optional
        The fraction of fiducial pairs selected for each germ-power base
        string.  The default includes all fiducial pairs.  Note that
        for each germ-power the selected pairs are *different* random
        sets of all possible pairs (unlike fid_pairs, which specifies the
        *same* fiducial pairs for *all* same-germ base strings).  If
        fid_pairs is used in conjuction with keep_fraction, the pairs
        specified by fid_pairs are always selected, and any additional
        pairs are randomly selected.

    keep_seed : int, optional
        The seed used for random fiducial pair selection (only relevant
        when keep_fraction < 1).

    include_lgst : boolean, optional
        If true, then the starting list (only applicable when
        `nest == True`) is the list of LGST strings rather than the
        empty list.  This means that when `nest == True`, the LGST
        sequences will be included in all the lists.

    op_label_aliases : dictionary, optional
        Dictionary whose keys are operation label "aliases" and whose values are tuples
        corresponding to what that operation label should be expanded into before querying
        the dataset.  This information is stored within the returned operation sequence
        structures.  Defaults to the empty dictionary (no aliases defined)
        e.g. opLabelAliases['Gx^3'] = ('Gx','Gx','Gx')

    sequence_rules : list, optional
        A list of `(find,replace)` 2-tuples which specify string replacement
        rules.  Both `find` and `replace` are tuples of operation labels
        (or `Circuit` objects).

    dscheck : DataSet, optional
        A data set which is checked for each of the generated operation sequences. When
        a generated sequence is missing from this `DataSet`, action is taken
        according to `action_if_missing`.

    action_if_missing : {"raise","drop"}, optional
        The action to take when a generated gate sequence is missing from
        `dscheck` (only relevant when `dscheck` is not None).  "raise" causes
        a ValueError to be raised; "drop" causes the missing sequences to be
        dropped from the returned set.

    germ_length_limits : dict, optional
        A dictionary limiting the max-length values used for specific germs.
        Keys are germ sequences and values are integers.  For example, if
        this argument is `{('Gx',): 4}` and `max_length_list = [1,2,4,8,16]`,
        then the germ `('Gx',)` is only repeated using max-lengths of 1, 2,
        and 4 (whereas other germs use all the values in `max_length_list`).

    verbosity : int, optional
        The level of output to print to stdout.

    Returns
    -------
    list of LsGermsStructure objects
        The i-th object corresponds to a operation sequence list containing repeated
        germs limited to length max_length_list[i].  If nest == True, then
        repeated germs limited to previous max-lengths are also included.
        Note that a "0" maximum-length corresponds to the LGST strings.

    List all the circuits (i.e. experiments) required for long-sequence GST (LSGST).

    Returns a single list containing, without duplicates, all the gate
    strings required throughout all the iterations of LSGST given by
    max_length_list.  Thus, the returned list is equivalently the list of
    the experiments required to run LSGST using the supplied parameters,
    and so commonly used when construting data set templates or simulated
    data sets.  The breakdown of which operation sequences are used for which
    iteration(s) of LSGST is given by make_lsgst_lists(...).

    Parameters
    ----------
    op_label_src : list or Model
        List of operation labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a Model,
        then the model's gate and instrument labels are used. Only
        relevant when `include_lgst == True`.

    prep_strs : list of Circuits
        List of the preparation fiducial operation sequences, which follow state
        preparation.

    effect_strs : list of Circuits
        List of the measurement fiducial operation sequences, which precede
        measurement.

    germ_list : list of Circuits
        List of the germ operation sequences.

    max_length_list : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths.

    fid_pairs : list of 2-tuples, optional
        Specifies a subset of all fiducial string pairs (prepStr, effectStr)
        to be used in the operation sequence lists.  If a list, each element of
        fid_pairs is a (iPrepStr, iEffectStr) 2-tuple of integers, each
        indexing a string within prep_strs and effect_strs, respectively, so
        that prepStr = prep_strs[iPrepStr] and effectStr =
        effect_strs[iEffectStr].  If a dictionary, keys are germs (elements
        of germ_list) and values are lists of 2-tuples specifying the pairs
        to use for that germ.

    trunc_scheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means. If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    keep_fraction : float, optional
        The fraction of fiducial pairs selected for each germ-power base
        string.  The default includes all fiducial pairs.  Note that
        for each germ-power the selected pairs are *different* random
        sets of all possible pairs (unlike fid_pairs, which specifies the
        *same* fiduicial pairs for *all* same-germ base strings).  If
        fid_pairs is used in conjuction with keep_fraction, the pairs
        specified by fid_pairs are always selected, and any additional
        pairs are randomly selected.

    keep_seed : int, optional
        The seed used for random fiducial pair selection (only relevant
        when keep_fraction < 1).

    include_lgst : boolean, optional
        If true, then ensure that LGST sequences are included in the
        returned list.

    Create a set of operation sequence lists for eLGST based on germs and max-lengths

    (eLGST) algorithm.  If `include_lgst == True` then the starting list is the
    list of length-1 operation label strings, otherwise the starting list is empty.
    For each nonzero element of max_length_list, call it L, a list of operation sequences is
    created with the form:

    If nest == True, the above list is iteratively *added* (w/duplicates
    removed) to the current list of operation sequences to form a final list for the

    contains all the elements of previous-L lists.  If nest == False then

        then the model's gate and instrument labels are used. Only

    germ_list : list of Circuits
        List of the germ operation sequences.

    max_length_list : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths. A zero value in this list has special
        meaning, and corresponds to the length-1 operation label strings.

    trunc_scheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means.  If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    nest : boolean, optional
        If True, the returned operation sequence lists are "nested", meaning
        that each successive list of operation sequences contains all the gate
        strings found in previous lists (and usually some additional
        new ones).  If False, then the returned string list for maximum
        length == L contains *only* those operation sequences specified in the
        description above, and *not* those for previous values of L.

    include_lgst : boolean, optional
        If true, then the starting list (only applicable when
        `nest == True`) is the list of length-1 operation label strings
        rather than the empty list.  This means that when
        `nest == True`, the length-1 sequences will be included in all
        the lists.

    Returns
    -------
    list of (lists of Circuits)
        The i-th list corresponds to a operation sequence list containing repeated
        germs limited to length max_length_list[i].  If nest == True, then
        repeated germs limited to previous max-lengths are also included.
