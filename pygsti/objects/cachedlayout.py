    A COPA Layout that includes a generic per-circuit cache dictionary.

    A commonly useful addition to the base COPA layout is to add a persistent
    "cache" dictionary that tags along with each circuit, so that parts of
    computations that depend *only* on the circuit (and its outcomes) can be
    computed just once.

        TODO: docstring
        Simplifies a list of :class:`Circuit`s.

        Circuits must be "simplified" before probabilities can be computed for
        them. Each string corresponds to some number of "outcomes", indexed by an
        "outcome label" that is a tuple of POVM-effect or instrument-element
        labels like "0".  Compiling creates maps between operation sequences and their
        outcomes and the structures used in probability computation (see return
        values below).

        Parameters
        ----------
        circuits : list of Circuits
            The list to simplify.

        dataset : DataSet, optional
            If not None, restrict what is simplified to only those
            probabilities corresponding to non-zero counts (observed
            outcomes) in this data set.

        cache : dict
            A dictionary whose keys are the elements of `circuits` and values can be
            whatever the user wants.  These values are provided when calling
            :method:`iter_circuits_with_cache`.
