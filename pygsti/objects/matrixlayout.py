    TODO: update docstring

    An Evaluation Tree that structures circuits for efficient multiplication of process matrices.

    MatrixEvalTree instances create and store the decomposition of a list of circuits into
    a sequence of 2-term products of smaller strings.  Ideally, this sequence would
    prescribe the way to obtain the entire list of circuits, starting with just the single
    gates, using the fewest number of multiplications, but this optimality is not
    guaranteed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    items : list, optional
        Initial items.  This argument should only be used internally
        in the course of serialization.

        of this strategy (a circuit probability array layout) among when calling `distribute`.
        By default, the communicator is not divided.  This default behavior is fine for cases
        when derivatives are being taken, as multiple processors are used to process differentiations
        with respect to different variables.  If no derivaties are needed, however, this should be
        set to (at least) the number of processors.
