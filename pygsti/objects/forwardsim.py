class ForwardSimulator(object):
    """
    A calculator of circuit outcome probability calculations and their derivatives w.r.t. model parameters.

    Some forward simulators may also be used to perform operation-product calculations.

    This functionality exists in a class separate from Model to allow for additional
    model classes (e.g. ones which use entirely different -- non-gate-local
    -- parameterizations of operation matrices and SPAM vectors) access to these
    fundamental operations.  It also allows for the easier addition of new forward simulators.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dim : int
        The model-dimension.  All operations act on a `dim`-dimensional Hilbert-Schmidt space.

    layer_op_server : LayerLizard
        An object that can be queried for circuit-layer operations.
