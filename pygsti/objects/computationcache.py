class ComputationCache(object):
    """
    A cache used to speed up circuit probability calculations.

    This object stores information and computated quantities for calculations
    involving the *same* model, dataset, and set of circuits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eval_tree : EvalTree
        An evaluation tree, storing the set of circuits in a simplified
        and structured way in order to improve the efficiency of later computations.

    lookup : collections.OrderedDict
        A dictionary whose keys are integer indices into the master circuit list and
        whose values are slices and/or integer-arrays into the space/axis of
        final elements returned by the 'bulk fill' forward simulator routines.  Thus,
        to get the  final elements corresponding to the ith circuits, use
        `filledArray[ lookup[i] ]`.

    outcomes : collections.OrderedDict
        A dictionary whose keys are integer indices into the master circuit list
        and whose values are lists of outcome labels (an outcome label is a tuple
        of POVM-effect and/or instrument-element labels).  Thus, to obtain
        what outcomes the i-th circuits's final elements (`filledArray[ lookup[i] ]`)
        correspond to, use `outcomes[i]`.

    wrt_block_size : int or float, optional
      The maximum average number of derivative columns to compute quantities for
      simultaneously.  None typically means to compute all the columns at once.

    wrt_block_size2 : int or float, optional
      The maximum average number of 2nd derivative columns to compute quantities for
      simultaneously (for those which use second derivatives, e.g. Hessians).

    counts : numpy.ndarray
        A 1D vector of outcome counts, one per computed element.

    total_counts : numpy.ndarray
        A 1D vector of total (per-circuit) outcome counts, one per computed element.
