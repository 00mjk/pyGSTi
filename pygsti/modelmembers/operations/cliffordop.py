class CliffordOp(_LinearOperator):
    """
    A Clifford operation, represented via a symplectic matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    unitary : numpy.ndarray
        The unitary action of the clifford operation.

    symplecticrep : tuple, optional
        A (symplectic matrix, phase vector) 2-tuple specifying the pre-
        computed symplectic representation of `unitary`.  If None, then
        this representation is computed automatically from `unitary`.

    evotype : {"stabilizer"}
        The evolution type.

        """
        Creates a new CliffordOp from a unitary operation.

        Note: while the clifford operation is held internally in a symplectic
        representation, it is also be stored as a unitary (so the `unitary`
        argument is required) for keeping track of global phases when updating
        stabilizer frames.

        If a non-Clifford unitary is specified, then a ValueError is raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        unitary : numpy.ndarray
            The unitary action of the clifford operation.

        symplecticrep : tuple, optional
            A (symplectic matrix, phase vector) 2-tuple specifying the pre-

            this representation is computed automatically from `unitary`.
