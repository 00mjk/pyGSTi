    A POVM that just holds a set of effect vectors, parameterized individually however you want.

    Parameters
    ----------
    effects : dict of POVMEffects or array-like
        A dict (or list of key,value pairs) of the effect vectors.

    evotype : Evotype or str, optional
        The evolution type.  If `None`, the evotype is inferred
        from the first effect vector.  If `len(effects) == 0` in this case,
        an error is raised.

    state_space : StateSpace, optional
        The state space for this POVM.  If `None`, the space is inferred
        from the first effect vector.  If `len(effects) == 0` in this case,
        an error is raised.
