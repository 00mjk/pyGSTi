class ComplementSPAMVec(_ConjugatedStatePOVMEffect):
    """
    TODO: docstring
    A POVM effect vector that ensures that all the effects of a POVM sum to the identity.

    This SPAM vector is paramterized as `I - sum(other_spam_vecs)` where `I` is
    a (static) identity element and `other_param_vecs` is a list of other spam
    vectors in the same parent :class:`POVM`.  This only *partially* implements
    the SPAMVec interface (some methods such as `to_vector` and `from_vector`
    will thunk down to base class versions which raise `NotImplementedError`),
    as instances are meant to be contained within a :class:`POVM` which takes
    care of vectorization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    identity : array_like or SPAMVec
        a 1D numpy array representing the static identity operation from
        which the sum of the other vectors is subtracted.

    other_spamvecs : list of SPAMVecs
        A list of the "other" parameterized SPAM vectors which are
        subtracted from `identity` to compute the final value of this
        "complement" SPAM vector.
