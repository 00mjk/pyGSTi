# Model Violation Analysis
Metrics indicating how well the estimated gate set can be trusted -- i.e., how well it fits the data.
### ProgressTable:
  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Comparison between the computed and expected maximum <span class="math">\log(\mathcal{L})</span> for different values of <span class="math">L</span>.</span> <span class="captiondetail"> <span class="math">N_S</span> and <span class="math">N_p</span> are the number of gate strings and parameters, respectively.  The quantity <span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> measures the goodness of fit of the GST model (small is better) and is expected to lie within <span class="math">[k-\sqrt{2k},k+\sqrt{2k}]</span> where <span class="math">k = N_s-N_p</span>. <span class="math">N_\sigma = (2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})-k)/\sqrt{2k}</span> is the number of standard deviations from the mean (a <span class="math">p</span>-value can be straightforwardly derived from <span class="math">N_\sigma</span>).  The rating from 1 to 5 stars gives a very crude indication of goodness of fit.</span></figcaption>
  <!--<span class="math">p</span> is the p-value derived from a <span class="math">\chi^2_k</span> distribution.(For example, if <span class="math">p=0.05</span>, then the probability of observing a <span class="math">\chi^{2}</span> value as large as, or larger than, the one indicated in the table is 5%%, assuming the GST model is valid.) -->

  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle"><span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> contributions for every individual experiment in the dataset.</span> <span class="captiondetail"> Each pixel represents a single experiment (gate sequence), and its color indicates whether GST was able to fit the corresponding frequency well.  Shades of white/gray are typical. Red squares represent statistically significant evidence for model violation (non-Markovianity), and should appear with probability at most %(linlg_pcntle)s%% if the data really are Markovian. Square blocks of pixels correspond to base sequences (arranged vertically by germ and horizontally by length); each pixel within a block corresponds to a specific choice of pre- and post-fiducial sequences.  See text for further details.</span></figcaption>

Values of 1.0 indicate all of the original data was used, whereas numbers between 0 and 1 indicate that the data counts for the experiement were artificially decreased (usually to improve the fit).</span></figcaption>
