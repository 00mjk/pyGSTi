# Dataset comparisons
This report contains information for more than one data set.  This page shows comparisons between different data sets.

### Histogram of p-values comparing two data sets. 
Each gate sequence is assigned a p-value based on how consistent that sequence's counts are between the two selected data sets.  The line shows what would be expected for perfectly consistent data.

# Per-sequence $2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ values comparing two data sets.
In a similar fashion to other color box plots, this plot shows two times the log-likelihood-ratio for each gate sequence corresponding to how consistent that sequences' counts are between the two selected data sets.  The likelihood ratio is between a models that supposes there is either one or two separate probability distributions from which the data counts are drawn.
