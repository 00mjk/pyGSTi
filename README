Overview:
--------
This is the root directory of the pyGSTi software, which is a python
 implementation of Gate Set Tomography.  pyGSTi free software, licensed
 under the GNU public license (GPL).  Copyright and license information
 can be found in license.txt, and the GPL itself in COPYING.



Brief description of the directory structure:
--------------------------------------------

doc/  :  Directory containing the HTML documentation and other
         reference documents.

ipython_notebooks/  : Parent directory of all iPython notebook tutorial
		      files included with pyGSTi.  It is convenient to
		      start an iPython notebook server from within this
		      directory.

packages/  :  Directory containing the (one) package provided by pyGSTi.
	      All of the python source code lies here.

tests/  :  Directory containing pyGSTi unit tests.

install_locally.py :  A Python script that sets up the software to run 
		      from its current location within the file system.  This
		      essentially adds the packages directory to the list of
		      directories Python uses to search for packages in, so
		      that "import pygsti" will work for any Python script, 
		      regardless of its location in the file system.  This
		      action is local to the user running the script, and does
                      not copy any files to any system directories, making it
		      a good option for a user without administrative access.

COPYING  :  A text version of the GNU Public License.

license.txt  :  A text file giving copyright and licensing information
	        about pyGSTi.
