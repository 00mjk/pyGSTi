<h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>GST characterizes logic operations on a quantum device (e.g., a qubit), by treating it as a black box. This black box is equipped with a small set of “buttons” that apply quantum <em>gates</em> to the quantum system inside. One button initializes it, a second button triggers a 2-outcome measurement, and the remaining buttons perform transformations. We avoid assumptions about the device&apos;s operation whenever possible. Currently, we assume that: </p>

  <ul>
   <li>the quantum device is a qubit (has a Hilbert space of dimension 2),</li>
   <li>each <em>gate</em>, or logic operation, can be represented by a stationary Markov process (a.k.a. “quantum channel”).</li>
  </ul>
