        <h1>Model Violation Analysis: Robust data scaling</h1>
        <p>GST datasets are often <em>very</em> inconsistent with the Markovian gateset model.  This is relatively unsurprising, and means only that real qubits often drift or experience other forms of noise that aren't stationary and Markovian.  But this "voids the warranty" on GST's results, at least in principle.  The properties of the estimated gates usually appear to be meaningful anyway, but when the model is violated, normal methods for generating <em>error bars</em> become radically overoptimistic.  As a partial remedy for this, pyGSTi can be configured to generate "robust" analyses of model-violating data, by artificially deprecating data that are inconsistent with the fit (a variant of some robust statistics methods).  If the estimate currently selected on the sidebar used this technique, then this tab shows how much each individual experiment (circuit) was deprecated (essentially, by throwing out many of the counts for that circuit while keeping the overall observed frequencies constant).</p>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Data scaling factor for each circuit in the dataset.</span> <span class="captiondetail">Each colored box represents a single experiment (circuit), arranged in the same way as in other related tabs.  A circuit's color indicates the how much the original data counts were scaled down when they were used to compute the log-likelihood or <span class="math">\chi^2</span> for this estimate (and its error bars).  A white box (value 1.0) indicates that all of the original data was used, because that circuit was not originally seen to be inconsistent with the fit. On the other hand, gray or black boxes (numbers between 0 and 1) indicate that the total number of counts for that circuit was scaled down (multiplied by the given factor) to reduce its significance, and therefore that circuit's inconsistency with the fit.  Generally, the only circuits scaled down are those deemed significantly inconsistent in the original (unscaled) fit.</span></figcaption>
