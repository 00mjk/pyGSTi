	<h1>Gate Error Generators</h1>
	<p>This tab shows the error generator corresponding to each of the gates, and its projection onto the generators of different types of known errors.  Since the gate matrices are gauge-dependent, so are the error generators and their projections.</p>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Logic gate error generators</span> <span class="captiondetail"> The <b>first column</b> displays a heat map of the estimated <q>Error Generator</q> for each gate, which is the Lindbladian <span class="math">\mathbb{L}</span> that describes <em>how</em> the gate is failing to match the target.  This error generator is defined by the equation %(errorgenformula)s. When all the elements of an error generator are zero, the estimated gate matches the corresponding ideal target gate.  Note that the range of the <span style="color:red">color</span> <span style="color:blue">scale</span> is variable, being determined by the data. <b>Subsequent columns</b> show the result of projectign each generator onto the spaces of different classes of well-known error generators.  The Hamiltonian generators act by commutation with each Pauli basis element <span class="math">B_i</span>, that is <span class="math">\rho \rightarrow -i[B_i, \rho]</span>.  Stochastic generators act by conjugation with each basis element, <span class="math">\rho \rightarrow B_i \rho B_i^\dagger</span>.  Affine generators act by projecting everything onto a particular basis element, <span class="math">\rho \rightarrow \mathrm{Tr}(\rho) B_i</span>.</span></figcaption>
