	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Per-sequence model violation box plot.</span><span class="captiondetail"> This plot shows the <span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> contribution for every individual experiment in the dataset.  Each pixel represents a single gate sequence, and its color indicates whether GST was able to fit the corresponding frequency well.  Shades of white/gray indicate typical (within the expected) values. Red squares represent statistically significant evidence for model violation (non-Markovianity), and should appear with probability at most %(linlg_pcntle)s%% if the data really are Markovian. Square blocks of pixels (<q>plaquettes</q>)correspond to different germ-power base sequences (arranged vertically by germ and horizontally by length); each pixel within a block corresponds to a specific choice of pre- and post-fiducial sequences.  Hovering over a block displays the gate sequence and associated data.</span></figcaption>
