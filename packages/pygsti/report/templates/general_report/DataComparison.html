        <h1>Data set comparisons</h1>
	<p>This report contains information for more than one data set.  This page shows comparisons between different data sets.</p>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">For every pair of data sets, the likelihood is computed for two different models: 1) the model in which a single set of probabilities (one per gate sequence, obtained by the combined outcome frequencies) generates both data sets, and 2) the model in which each data is generated from different sets of probabilities.  Twice the ratio of these log-likelihoods can be compared to the value that is expected when model 1) is valid.  This plot shows the difference between the expected and actual twice-log-likelihood ratio in units of  standard deviations.  Zero or negative values indicate the data sets appear to be generated by the same underlying probabilities.  Large positive values indicate the data sets appear to be generated by different underlying probabilities.</span></figcaption>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Histogram of p-values comparing two data sets.</span> <span class="captiondetail">  Each gate sequence is assigned a p-value based on how consistent that sequence's counts are between the two selected data sets.  The line shows what would be expected for perfectly consistent data.</span></figcaption>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Per-sequence <span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> values comparing two data sets.</span> <span class="captiondetail"> In a similar fashion to other color box plots, this plot shows two times the log-likelihood-ratio for each gate sequence corresponding to how consistent that sequences' counts are between the two selected data sets.  The likelihood ratio is between a models that supposes there is either one or two separate probability distributions from which the data counts are drawn.</span></figcaption>
