	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Logic gate operations</span> <span class="captiondetail"> Compares the <em>ideal</em> (generally unitary) <q>target</q> logic gates with those <em>estimated</em> by GST.  Each gate is represented as a <span class="math">d^2\times d^2</span> <em>superoperator</em> that acts by matrix multiplication on vectors in <span class="math">\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})</span>.  Matrices are displayed using a heat map that ranges between 1.0 (<span style="color:red">red</span>) and -1.0 (<span style="color:blue">blue</span>).  Note that it is impossible to discern even order-1%% deviations from the ideal using this color scale, and one should rely on other analysis for more a precise comparison.</span></figcaption>
