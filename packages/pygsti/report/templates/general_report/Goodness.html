	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Detailed overall model violation.</span> <span class="captiondetail"> This table gives the details of the comparison between the computed and expected maximum <span class="math">\log(\mathcal{L})</span> (the log-likelihood) for different values of <span class="math">L</span> (roughly the maximum sequence length).  Quantities <span class="math">N_S</span> and <span class="math">N_p</span> are the number of data set degrees-of-freedom and model parameters, respectively.  The quantity <span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> measures the goodness of fit of the GST model (small is better) and is expected to lie within <span class="math">[k-\sqrt{2k},k+\sqrt{2k}]</span> where <span class="math">k = N_s-N_p</span>. <span class="math">N_\sigma = (2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})-k)/\sqrt{2k}</span> is the number of standard deviations from the mean (a <span class="math">p</span>-value can be straightforwardly derived from <span class="math">N_\sigma</span>).  The rating from 1 to 5 stars gives a very crude indication of goodness of fit.  Heading tool tips provide descriptions of each column's value.</span></figcaption>
	  <!--<span class="math">p</span> is the p-value derived from a <span class="math">\chi^2_k</span> distribution.(For example, if <span class="math">p=0.05</span>, then the probability of observing a <span class="math">\chi^{2}</span> value as large as, or larger than, the one indicated in the table is 5%%, assuming the GST model is valid.) -->

The sequence length is the x-coordinate, so this plot may reveal the typically direct relationship between the goodness-of-fit and sequence length.</span> </figcaption>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Per-sequence model violation box plot.</span><span class="captiondetail"> This plot shows the <span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> contribution for every individual experiment in the dataset.  Each pixel represents a single gate sequence, and its color indicates whether GST was able to fit the corresponding frequency well.  Shades of white/gray indicate typical (within the expected) values. Red squares represent statistically significant evidence for model violation (non-Markovianity), and should appear with probability at most %(linlg_pcntle)s%% if the data really are Markovian. Square blocks of pixels (<q>plaquettes</q>)correspond to different germ-power base sequences (arranged vertically by germ and horizontally by length); each pixel within a block corresponds to a specific choice of pre- and post-fiducial sequences.  Hovering over a block displays the gate sequence and associated data.</span></figcaption>
