	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Model violation summary.</span> <span class="captiondetail">This plot shows how well GST was able to fit your data to a gate set.  Bars indicate the difference between the actual and expected log-likelihood values, and are given in units of standard deviations of the appropriate <span class="math">\chi^2</span> distribution. One bar is shown for each value of <span class="math">L</span> (roughly the maximum sequence length); low values are better (less model violation), and bars are colored according to the <q>star</q> rating found in a later table detailing the overall model violation.</span></figcaption>

	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Per-sequence model violation.</span> <span class="captiondetail"> This plot shows a histogram of the per-sequence goodness-of-fit values (<span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span>, twice the difference between the expected and actual log-likelihood).  Each sequence equals one count.  Lower values are better, and the colorscale, simply a function of the x-coordinate, matches that found on other more detailed plots of per-sequence model violation.</span> </figcaption>
