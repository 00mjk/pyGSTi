<p>Welcome to a pyGSTi <em>comparison</em> report, designed to compare multiple data sets and/or estimates.  This report is organized into <q>tabs</q>, each of which is accessible from the sidebar on the left.  This Summary tab summarizes the most popular analyses and figures of merit.  More detailed analysis is available on other tabs.</p>

	<figure id="finalFitComparePlot" class='tbl'>
	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Model violation summary.</span> <span class="captiondetail">This figure is about goodness-of-fit.  This plot shows how well each estimate fits the data.    PyGSTi finds the maximum value of the loglikelihood (<span class="math">-2\log\mathrm{Pr(data|gateset)}</span>), and compares it to what we expect to see <i>if</i> the data were generated by a Markovian gateset.  In this plot, each bar or box shows by how many standard deviations the <i>actual</i> log-likelihood exceeds its expected value.  Expected values and standard deviations are derived from <span class="math">\chi^2</span> theory.  Low values indicate better fits (less model violation).</span></figcaption>
