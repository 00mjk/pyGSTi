In order to use pyGSTi you need to\r\ntell your python distribution where pyGSTi lives, which can be done in one\r\n of two ways:\r\n\r\n1) run: \"python install_locally.py\" \r\n\r\n  This adds the current pyGSTi path to python's list of search paths, and\r\n  doesn't required administrative access (but only applies to the current user).\r\n\r\n2) run: python setup.py install\r\n\r\n  This installs the pyGSTi python package into one of the python distribution's\r\n  search directories.  This typically requires administrative privileges, and\r\n  is the way most python packages are installed.  Installing this way has the\r\n  advantage that it makes the package available to all users and then allows \r\n  you to move or delete the directory you're installing from.\r\n\r\n  The reason why you may *not* want to use this installation method is that \r\n  pyGSTi comes with (iPython notebook) tutorials that you may want to access.\r\n  And if you're keeping the tutorial files somewhere in your local user\r\n  directories, you may want to just place the entire pyGSTi directory there\r\n  use method 1) above.\r\n\r\nAfter you've installed pyGSTi, you should be able to import the \r\n\"pygsti\" Python package.  The next thing to do is take a look at\r\nthe tutorials, which you do by:\r\n\r\n- change to the notebook directory, by running:\r\n  cd ipython_notebooks  \r\n\r\n- start up the iPython notebook server by running:\r\n  ipython notebook\r\n\r\nThe iPython server should open up your web browser to the server root,\r\nfrom where you can navigate to the \"Tutorials\" folder and start the \r\nfirst \"00\" tutorial notebook.  Note that the key command to execute\r\na cell within the iPython notebook is \"Shift+Enter\", not just \"Enter\".\r\n\r\nCongratulations!  You're up and running with pyGSTi!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions?\r\nFor help and support with pyGSTi, please contact the authors at\r\npygsti@sandia.gov.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
